# kidLAB

A generic child theme for WordPress. It is set to work with the Twenty Twenty theme. You will need to make adjustments in the functions.php and style.css to make it work with a different theme. You might also consider to delete the footer.php filke, if you want to keep your themes original footer (which is probably advisable at first). This is -- as simple as it might seem -- an experimantal project without any guarantees to work.

Enjoy!
